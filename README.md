# Week 2 Challenge-My Portfolio

## Description

This is the first draft of my personal portfolio using only *HTML* and *CSS* to design and style the webpage.  I built this project so that I can showcase my **skills** as a developer.  I will continue to build and expand on this project as my **skills** and **knowlege** and **experience** grow.  My portfolio will exhibit both *front end* and *back end* components.  Upon completion, I will have a **functional**, **beautiful**, and **interactive** product to show future employers the kind of *asset* that I can be.  Since there are many moving parts to what a developer does, this porfolio will keep all of my projects in one place and make them easy to access and view.  

My current project includes the following:

**HTML**
**CSS**

My next iteration will indclude:

*JavaScript*
